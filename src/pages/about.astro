        Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Sidney Sussex College and the Kavli Institute for Cosmology,
        the University of Cambridge, under Prof Roberto Maiolino and Dr Sandro Tacchella. I am part of the Galaxy Formation
        and Evolution group, which is affiliated with both the Kavli Institute for Cosmology and Cavendish Laboratory.

      <p>
        My research interests revolve around galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe: how the first stars and galaxies
        were formed, and how they subsequently brought about the Reionisation of the Universe, a major phase transition that turned
        the neutral Universe back to a (mostly) ionised state.
      </p>
      <br />

        I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge with Dr Renske Smit and Prof Roberto Maiolino. Before my PhD,
        I was at the Institute of Astronomy for the Master of Advanced Study in Astrophysics. I completed my undergraduate degree
        at the University of Leiden, studying Physics and Astronomy.

        Outside of astronomy, I enjoy sports and the outdoors. I've played baseball since I was 5, started rowing at university
        and have since picked up cycling as well.

        Apart from being a professional astronomer, I also enjoy stargazing as an amateur. At the
        Old Observatory in Leiden, I learnt to operate the historical six-inch, ten-inch, and photographic double refractor
        telescopes (dating back to 1838), as well as being involved in outreach as tour guide and museum custodian.
