This Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so. It also covers your choices regarding the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of this website.

## Who we are

My name is Joris Witstok, and this is my personal website. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please [contact me](/contact). On this page, I will use the aggregate ‘we’ for simplicity. We will never sell your personal data to anyone.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Usage data

When you visit our site, we will store: the website from which you visited us from, the parts of our site you visit, page generation time, the date and duration of your visit, links to an outside domain that were clicked, your anonymised IP address, pseudonymised user ID, and information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit. We process this usage data in Matomo Analytics for statistical purposes, to improve our site and to recognise and stop any misuse. Data collected is used only for the audience measurement and evaluation of the website performance and not other purposes.

### Cookies

We use cookies (small data files transferred onto computers or devices by sites) for record-keeping purposes and to enhance functionality on our site. You may deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings of your web browser. Cookies that are already stored may be deleted at any time.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## How long we retain your data

Anonymised tracking data of individual users is stored for the duration of a year. We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymised, or pseudonymised  information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.
